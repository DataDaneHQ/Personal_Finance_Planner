# Personal Finance Dashboard in Excel

<br>

Welcome to my Personal Finance Dashboard project, a comprehensive Excel-based tool designed to help you take control of your finances with ease and precision. This dashboard is an evolution of the original template created by The Office Lab, which laid the groundwork for a zero-based, multi-period budget planner. My version builds upon that foundation, incorporating additional features that reflect my personal finance tracking needs while showcasing the Excel skills I've honed through practice and learning.

## About the Dashboard

The spreadsheet consists of six sheets: Settings, Budget Planning, Budget Tracking, Budget Dashboard, Calculations, and Dropdown List Data. To help you see the final dashboard result, I have populated the planning and tracking sheets with dummy data.

This Excel Personal Finance Dashboard allows you to plan, track, and visualize your budget with minimal effort. It covers every aspect required to gain full control over your personal finances, from planning inconsistent income and expenses to managing your savings. The interactive dashboard at the heart of this tool presents both planned and tracked budget data in a smart, user-friendly way, setting new standards in data visualization within Excel.

## Key Features

***[Zero-Based Multi-Period Budget Planning](Images/01%20-%20Budget_Planning.png)*** This feature enables you to plan your months and years ahead with almost zero effort, giving you full control over your money flows. It’s designed to handle inconsistent income streams, such as yearly, quarterly, or monthly-changing categories.

***[Budget Tracking:](Images/02%20-%20Budget_Tracking.png)*** The Budget Tracking sheet allows you to easily track and sort all your income, savings, and expenses. Dropdown lists are provided in the "Type," "Category," and "Bank Acc." columns. The Category dropdown choices dynamically update depending on the Type chosen in the previous column, allowing you to specify exactly where your income, savings, or expense is coming from.

***[Interactive Budget Dashboard:](Images/03%20-%20Budget_Dashboard.png)*** The dashboard consolidates all budget data into one powerful, interactive visual display, allowing you to monitor and evaluate your budget performance with ease. The UX/UI design and the composition of calculations set a high standard for Excel-based tools.

***[Bank Account Integration:](Images/04%20-%20Bank_Balance_Integration.png)*** To align the budget with real-life finances, I’ve added a column in the Budget Tracking sheet that includes a dropdown list of your bank accounts. The financial overview panel now features a box displaying the balance of your accounts, ensuring your budget aligns with what’s actually in your bank.

***[Tracking "Needs and Wants":](Images/05%20-%20Needs_and_Wants.png)*** Understanding the difference between essential and discretionary spending is crucial for effective budgeting. I’ve incorporated a new doughnut chart that tracks expenses divided into "needs" and "wants." By setting targets—such as <45% for Needs, <35% for Wants, and >20% for Savings—you can better manage your finances. Conditional formatting highlights whether you’re meeting your targets, helping you adjust spending habits as necessary.

***[Savings Tracker with Stacked Bar Chart:](Images/06%20-%20Savings_Balance.png)*** Managing savings is simplified with a new stacked bar chart that tracks what’s in your bank account as savings. As you spend, the chart dynamically updates, showing the remaining balance in your savings categories. This feature helps you monitor how much of your savings is being used and ensures you’re on track with your financial goals.
